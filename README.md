## Features
- Responsive design that works on all device sizes
- Interactive elements using JavaScript
- SVG illustrations of the AMR robot in various applications
- Information about the robot's capabilities in hilly areas
- Details about market load applications
- Contact form for inquiries

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- SVG for illustrations

## Pages/Sections
1. **Home/Hero** - Introduction to the AMR robot
2. **About** - Detailed information about the robot's features
3. **Features** - Key capabilities and specifications
4. **Applications** - Use cases in hilly terrain and market load scenarios
5. **Contact** - Form for inquiries and contact information
